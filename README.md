## About The Project
https://benfro21.github.io/Jeopardy/

# Requirements
- For your first project, you'll be creating a familiar game using HTML, CSS and JS! You can create your own game or application
- Render in the browser
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Be deployed online using [Github Project pages](https://pages.github.com).
- Use semantic, valid markup for HTML and CSS (must pass validation without errors)
- Show a good commit history with frequent commits (minimum of one commit per project day)
# What I did Well
- The app will fetch 4 catagories from an api. The clues are then shuffled and added to the DOM. This causes a different experience each time you play.
- There are a few methods that I will come back to and clean up, but overall I feel the code is dry 
- I am proud that the whole app is in a class rather than a while loop. I should be able to improve it with ease. 
# Struggles 
- The api took more time then I expected, but when I got it to work everything seemed to fall in place 
- The CSS of the modal and gameboard gave me a challenge but I enjoyed working through it 
# API

## Planning
  # MVP User Stories 
  - As a user I want to click on any of the clues in whatever category I like
  - As a user I would like the gameboard to pre-populate with clues and categories so I can play right away.
  - As a user I want the clue to take up the size of the gameboard and be clear to read
  - As a user I want an area to submit my answer to said clue
  - As a user I want to see if my answer was correct or incorrect after submitting my answer
  - As a user I want to see the correct answer if my answer was wrong
  - As a user I want to see my score update as I answer clues
  - As a user I want to reset the game
  # Stretch Goals 
  - As a user I want different categories and clues each time I reset the game
  - As a user I want to play with a friend and base turn order off who answered the last question correctly
  - As a user I want to select my categories to play
  - As a user I want the jeopardy music to play while I answer a question
  - As a user I want to play a double jeopardy after a Jeopardy round that provides harder questions and double the points
  - As a user I want a start game button that fills the board with clue value when the game starts. A logo would cover the box until the game starts.
  - As a user I want a nav bar above the game to choose my categories, start/restart the game, and choose player 1/2 and enter their names.
  # Schedule
  - 4/30: Psudo code, file creation, HTML setup, basic css to see game,
  - 5/1: JS variable creation
